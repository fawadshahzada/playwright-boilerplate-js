Feature: Mixed UI and API Testing

Scenario: Verify data created by API is visible on the UI
    Given I send a POST request to "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts" with payload:
        | title | body | userId |
        | Test  | Test  | 1      |
        Then the response status should be 201
        And I navigate to the home page
        And I should see the post with title "Test"
